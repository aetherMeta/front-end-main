          Welcome to Aether Meta. Where we bring shopping to new heights. We are

          1. Accepting These Terms

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          This document and the other documents that we reference below make up
          our house rules, or what we officially call our Terms of Use (the
          “Terms” for short).
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Aether Meta
          Inc., regardless of your geographic location.

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Please note that Section 11. Disputes with Aether Meta, contains an
          arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to the Terms,
          you agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual
          arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those
          disputes decided by a judge or jury, and that you waive your right to
          participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative
          actions. *

          AetherMeta.io, Pattern by Aether Meta, our mobile apps, and the other
          services provided by Aether Meta (we’ll refer to all of these
          collectively as our “Services”), so please read it carefully. By using
          any of our Services (even just browsing one of our websites), you’re
          agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not

          Aether Meta’s Services connect people around the world, both online
          and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique digital, physical and
          phygital goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the
          specific rules that are relevant for you, depending on how you use the
          Services:

          Our House Rules for Everyone. If you use any of our Services, you

          our Terms, so be sure to read the ones that are relevant for you. Of

          3. Your Privacy
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          We know your personal information is important to you, so it’s
          important to us. Our Privacy Policy details how your information is
          collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our
          Services, you&apos;re also agreeing that we can process your
          information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Both Aether Meta and sellers process members’ personal information
          (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and are
          therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of
          buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party
          is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing
          the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a
          buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order,
          the seller, not Aether Meta, will be responsible for that unauthorized
          disclosure.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          If, however, Aether Meta and sellers are found to be joint data
          controllers of buyers’ personal information, and if Aether Meta is
          sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that
          you did as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you
          agree to indemnify Aether Meta for the expenses it occurs in
          connection with your processing of buyer personal information. See
          Section 9. Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued) below
          for more information about your indemnification obligations to Aether
          Meta.

          4. Your Account with Aether Meta
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          You’ll need to create an account with Aether Meta to use some of our
          Services. Here are a few rules about accounts with Aether Meta:
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          A. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services. Minors under 18
          and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services
          through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their
          appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children
          under 13 years are not permitted to use Aether Meta or the Services.
          You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a
          minor on your account, and there may be commercial products or
          services available that you may want to consider to limit a
          minor&apos;s access to material online.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          B. Provide accurate information about yourself and be honest. It’s
          prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or
          company through your account.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          C. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full
          name serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use
          language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone’s intellectual
          property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          D. You&apos;re responsible for your account. You’re solely responsible
          for any activity on your account. If you’re sharing an account with
          other people, then the person whose financial information is on the
          account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re
          registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you
          have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business.
          Also, your accounts are not transferable.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          E. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, you’re solely
          responsible for any activity on your account, so it’s important to
          keep your account password secure.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          F. These Terms don&apos;t create any agency, partnership, joint
          venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Aether
          Meta.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          G. If you are a Seller on Aether Meta, you have agreed to all our
          “Terms of Use” as mentioned in this article with the addition of the
          rights to use your intellectual properties (ie. logo, slogan, artwork,
          etc…) for marketing purposes. This also includes the non-exclusive
          rights to sell, advertise and promote on our platform.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="h4" mb="16px">
          5. Your Content
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s
          refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t make any claim to it, which
          includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names,
          profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews,
          comments, videos, usernames, etc.).
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          A. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely
          responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all
          necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not
          infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          B. Permission to Use Your Content. By posting Your Content through our
          Services, you grant Aether Meta a license to use it. We don’t claim
          any ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it
          to help Aether Meta function and grow. That way, we won’t infringe any
          rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For
          example, you acknowledge and agree Aether Meta may offer you or Aether
          Meta buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time, that may relate
          to your listings
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          C. Rights You Grant Aether Meta. (Here’s the legalese version of the
          last section). By posting Your Content, you grant Aether Meta a
          non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual
          license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store,
          and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to
          provide the Services and to promote Aether Meta, your Aether Meta
          shop, or the Services in general, in any formats and through any
          channels, including across any Aether Meta Services, our partners, or
          third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any
          moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content.
          You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance
          with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains
          any personal information.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          That sounds like a lot, but it’s necessary for us to keep Aether Meta
          going. Consider these examples: if you upload a photo or video of a
          listing on your Aether Meta shop, we have permission to display it to
          buyers, and we can resize or optimize it so it attract buyers using
          our platform; if you post a description in English, we can translate
          it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the story behind your
          item; and if you post a beautiful photo or video of your latest
          handmade necklace, we can feature it– often along with your shop name
          and shop picture– on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a
          billboard to help promote your business and Aether Meta’s.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          D. Reporting Unauthorized Content. Aether Meta has great respect for
          intellectual property rights, and is committed to following
          appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the
          Services. If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to
          the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please
          follow the steps listed in our Intellectual Property Policy. If Your
          Content is alleged to infringe another person’s intellectual property,
          we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we receive a
          report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating
          your account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify
          you if any of that happens.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be common
          sense, but there are certain types of content we don’t want posted on
          Aether Meta’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree
          that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening,
          defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive or in violation of
          our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is false and
          misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or
          deceptive.

        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          License to Use Our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services—subject to
          the Terms and the following restrictions in particular:
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          A. Don’t Use Our Services to Break the Law. You agree that you will
          not violate any laws in connection with your use of the Services. This
          includes any local, provincial (state), federal, and international
          laws that may apply to you. For example, it’s your responsibility to
          obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires, and to meet
          applicable legal requirements in applicable jurisdiction(s). This
          includes the sale and delivery of your items, such as age verification
          upon delivery, where required by law. You may not sell anything that
          violates any laws; you may not engage in fraud (including false claims
          or infringement notices), theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening
          conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Aether Meta,
          another Aether Meta user, or a third party.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          B. Pay Your Bills. You are responsible for paying all fees that you
          owe to Aether Meta. Except as set forth below, you are also solely
          responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any
          purchases or sales you make through our Services. Where applicable,
          Aether Meta will calculate, collect and remit value-added tax or VAT
          and sales tax. Some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g.
          Goods and Services Tax (GST), but we’ll just refer to VAT, GST, and
          any local sales taxes collectively as “VAT.” Please see “Fees &
          Payments Policy” for more information on taxes, including details on
          the taxes Aether Meta collects and remits from the buyers.

          C. You agree not to crawl, scrape, or spider any page of the Services
          or to reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of the
          Services (including both Aether Meta Intellectual Property and Seller
          Content) without our express permission.. If you want to use our API,
          please follow our “API Terms of Use”.

          D. You agree not to interfere with or try to disrupt our Services, for
          example by distributing a virus, excessive requests to our site or
          platform, or other harmful computer code.

          in connection with our Services (the Aether Meta Trademarks), are
          trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of Aether Meta in Canada and

          us improve your experience and our Services. Any ideas or other
          materials you submit to Aether Meta (not including Your Content or
          items you sell through our Services) are considered non-confidential
          and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide,
          irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish
          those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to
          you.

          G. From time to time, Aether Meta will provide you with certain legal
          information in writing. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to our
          “Electronic Communications Policy”, which describes how we provide
          that information to you. It says that we can send you information
          electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper copies
          (it’s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement
          is the same as your signature on paper.

          7. Termination
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Termination By You. You may terminate your account with Aether Meta at
          any time from your account settings. Terminating your account will not
          affect the availability of some of Your Content that you posted
          through the Services prior to termination. Oh, and you’ll still have
          to pay any outstanding bills.

          legal right to continue to use our Services, for example, to sell or

          you that your account has been terminated or suspended, unless you’ve

          websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links

          If Aether Meta gets sued because of something that you did, you agree

          claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises
          from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          If you’re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve
          your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will govern any legal
          dispute involving our Services:
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          A. Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the Province
          of Ontario, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws
          of Canada. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you
          live, but if you live outside of Canada, you may be entitled to the
          protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your
          local consumer protection law.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          B. Arbitration. You and Aether Meta agree that any dispute or claim
          arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by
          final and binding arbitration, using the English language,
          administered by the Canadian Arbitration Association (the “CAA”) under
          its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed
          to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date
          of these Terms) unless otherwise required by law. **Arbitration,
          including threshold questions of arbitrability of the dispute, will be
          handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment
          on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has
          jurisdiction.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Any arbitration or mediation under the Terms will take place on an
          individual basis. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you
          and Aether Meta are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action lawsuit. Class arbitrations shall only
          be available if requested by either party under its Class Action
          Arbitration Rules and approved by the arbitration entity.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to
          bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or
          other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by
          the arbitrator or mediator. You may instead assert your claim in
          “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim
          remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual,
          non-representative, and non-class basis.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          C. Costs of Arbitration. Payment for any and all reasonable CAA
          filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with
          the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and in the case of CEDR, its rules. If
          the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000 CAD, Aether Meta will
          pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees
          associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that
          either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous
          or brought for an improper purpose. For mediation through CEDR, the
          parties will pay their share of mediation costs, and under certain
          conditions such fees may be refundable to you, depending on the
          outcome of the mediation.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          D. Forum. We’re based in Toronto, Canada, so any legal action against
          Aether Meta related to our Services must be filed and take place in
          Toronto, Ontario, Canada. For all actions under the CAA Rules, the
          proceedings may be filed where your residence is, or in Toronto,
          Ontario, Canada, and any in-person hearings will be conducted at a
          location which is reasonably convenient to both parties taking into
          account their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. For
          any actions not subject to arbitration or mediation, you and Aether
          Meta agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a Province or
          federal court located in Greater Area of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          E. Government Exception. If you are a government agent or entity in
          Canada using the Services in your official capacity, and you are
          legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those
          clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action
          related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of Canada (without
          reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and
          to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of Ontario
          Province of Canada.

          F. Modifications. If we make any changes to this “Disputes with Aether
          Meta” section after the date you last accepted the Terms, those
          changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding
          against Aether Meta prior to the date the changes became effective.
          Aether Meta will notify you of substantive changes to the “Disputes
          with Aether Meta” section at least 30 days prior to the date the
          change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified
          terms, you may send Aether Meta a written notification (including
          email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a
          modified term or permanently closing your account, you agree to
          arbitrate any disputes between you and Aether Meta in accordance with
          the provisions of this “Disputes with Aether Meta” section as of the
          date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to
          your rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new
          account, you agree to be bound by the current version of the Terms.

        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the
          changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know by posting the
          changes through the Services and/or sending you an email or message
          about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to
          continue using the Services. Changes will be effective upon the
          posting of the changes unless otherwise specified. You are responsible
          for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of the

          The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms,
          supersede any other agreement between you and Aether Meta regarding
          the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable,
          that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the
          Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to
          enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later
          enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our
          rights and obligations under the Terms.
