          requirements. This includes applicable data protection and privacy
          laws that govern the ways in which you can use Aether Meta user
          information. These laws may require that you post and comply with your
          own privacy policy, which must be accessible to Aether Meta users with
          whom you interact. Your privacy policy must be compatible with this

          In particular, when you sell using our Services (subject to this
          Policy) or use Aether Meta’s API (also subject to the Aether Meta API
          Terms of Use), you may receive and determine what to do with certain
          personal information, such as when communicating with users and
          entering into transactions with buyers. This means you process
          personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and
          shipping address) and, to the extent you do so, you are an independent
          controller of data relating to other users that you may have obtained
          through the Services. As a data controller (that is someone who
          decides what personal data is collected and the purpose you’ll use the
          data for) to the extent that you process user personal information
          outside of the Services, you may be required under applicable data
          protection and privacy laws to honor requests received from such users
          for data access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to
          processing. Also, if you disclose personal information without the
          buyer’s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized
          disclosure. This includes, for example, disclosures you make or
          unintentional data breaches. For example, you may receive a buyer’s
          email address or other information as a result of entering into a
          transaction with that buyer. This information may only be used for
          Aether Meta-related communications or for Aether Meta-facilitated
          transactions. You may not use this information for unsolicited
          commercial messages or unauthorized transactions. Without the buyer’s
          consent, and subject to other applicable Aether Meta policies and
          laws, you may not add any Aether Meta member to your email or physical
          mailing list, use that buyer’s identity for marketing, or obtain or
          retain any payment information. Please bear in mind that you&apos;re
          responsible for knowing the standard of consent required in any given
          instance. If Aether Meta and you are found to be joint data
          controllers of personal information, and if Aether Meta is sued,
          fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did
          in your capacity as a joint data controller of buyer personal
          information, you agree to indemnify Aether Meta for the expenses it
          occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal
          information.

          If you are unable to complete a transaction, you must notify the buyer
          via Messages and cancel the transaction. If the buyer already
          submitted payment, you must issue a full refund. You are encouraged to
          keep proof of any refunds in the event a dispute arises.

          Reviews are a great way for you to build a reputation on Aether Meta.
          Buyers can leave a review within 100 days after the date of their
          item’s estimated delivery date. If an estimated delivery date is not
          available, the review window opens after the order’s processing time
          and shipping time have elapsed. Buyers can edit their review,
          including the photograph or video, any number of times during that 100
          day period.

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          On the rare occasion you receive an unfavorable review, you can reach
          out to the buyer or leave a response.

          Aether Meta reserves the right to resolve an order issue before the
          48-hour window for circumstances including, but not limited to, seller
          inactivity, harassment, refusal of service, manipulation, and

          Buyers may file a case for items that never arrive, arrive damaged, or
          do not match the listing description. Aether Meta may request your
          assistance in resolving a case opened against your shop. You
          understand that Aether Meta may use your personal information for the
          purpose of resolving disputes with other members.

        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          In order to keep Aether Meta safe and improve our Services, we may
          take actions that limit the visibility of your shop, listings or ads,
          or that impact your payment account. In the event a shop sees unusual
          order activity, or we otherwise believe that your actions or shop may
          result in buyer disputes, chargebacks, increased risk of fraud,
          counterfeiting, or other claims, Aether Meta may take actions such as
          limiting visibility of your account, or placing restrictions or
          reserves on your payments account, in accordance with our “Terms of
          Use”, including this Policy and our “Aether Meta Payments Policy”.
          When appropriate and permitted by law, Aether Meta will communicate
          information to the affected seller about the issue.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          In addition, we may limit the visibility of listings or ads in the
          interest of keeping Aether Meta safe, and improving our Services. For
          example, listings or ads may have decreased visibility because they
          include terms that represent a prohibited item or based on third party
          policies. These listings or ads may also be restricted from appearing
          in one or more features of the Services. While these listings or ads
          may have limited visibility, they are still discoverable in search.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Aether Meta may make changes to onboarding or authentication processes
          for sellers at our sole discretion. Completion of these processes may
          be required for seller account activation or continued access and
          usage.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          If Aether Meta has reason to believe you, Your Content, or your use of
          the services violate our Terms, including this “Seller Policy”, we may
          deactivate Your Content to some or all users, or suspend or terminate
          your account (and any accounts Aether Meta determines is related to
          your account) and your access to the Services. Generally, Aether Meta
          will notify you that Your Content or account has been suspended or
          terminated, unless you’ve repeatedly violated our Terms or we have
          legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying you.
