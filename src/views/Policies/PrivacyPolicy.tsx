        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          In the course of providing our Services, we collect or receive your
          personal information in a few different ways. We obtain the categories
          of personal information listed below from the following sources:
          directly from you, for example, from forms you complete or during
          registration; indirectly from you based on your activity and
          interaction with our Services, or from the device or browser you use
          to access the Services; from our vendors and suppliers that help
          provide Aether Meta services you may interact with (such as, for
          example, for payments or customer support), and from our third party
          advertising and marketing partners. Often, you choose what information
          to provide, but sometimes we require certain information to provide
          you the Services. Aether Meta uses the personal information it
          receives and collects in accordance with the purposes described in
          this policy.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          You can also choose to provide information to a third party via Aether
          Meta’s API. Users of Aether Meta’s API are required to follow Aether
          Meta’s API Terms of Use, including having appropriate privacy and
          security controls. Likewise, you may choose to link your Crypto Wallet
          to pay for purchases (or receive payment in the case of sellers)
          through a third-party service available through the Site or App.
          Aether Meta does not have a direct partner relationship with these
          third parties and their processing of information is subject to their
          own privacy policies. You should understand the privacy and security
          practices of any third party before you share information with them.

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Registration, Account Setup, Service Usage: In order to use the
          Services, will need to submit a valid email address. If you register,
          you will need to submit a name associated with your account. You may
          modify that name through your account settings. You need to provide
          this information to enable us to provide you with the Services.
          Additional information, such as a shop name, billing and payment
          information (including billing contact name, address, telephone
          number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or a
          physical postal address, may be necessary in order for us to provide a
          particular service. For example, we need a physical postal address if
          you are buying something on the Site for delivery. As an Aether Meta
          seller, if you choose to use our payment service (&quot;Aether Meta
          Payments&quot;), Aether Meta requires your full name, social security
          number, identification ID or tax ID, date of birth, bank account
          information, photograph, credit card information, and/or other proof
          of identification in order to verify your identity, provide this
          service to you, and comply with applicable law. For example, in
          certain markets, Aether Meta Sellers’ imprint (including trade name or
          individual name as applicable), may be displayed to buyers on Aether
          Meta in order to comply with local legal requirements. For both buyers
          and sellers, Aether Meta requires this information from you in order
          to provide you with the Services (including, to verify ownership of an
          account, to mitigate fraud and abuse, to comply with regulatory
          obligations, or to complete a transaction as a buyer or seller). We
          may store credit card information and other information provided to us
          during checkout, for billing and payment purposes, and to process your
          transaction. Members in certain countries can elect to save their
          credit card information to facilitate checkout for future purchases.
          If you&apos;re an Aether Meta buyer in the EU, Norway, Iceland,
          Liechtenstein or the United Kingdom, you may be asked to authenticate
          your payment method when you place your order. To authenticate a
          payment, you will need to respond to a prompt from your card issuer
          and provide additional information, such as a correct response to a
          question, a password, or a passcode. Aether Meta may contact
          individual shop owners confidentially to request more information
          about their shops or items listed through the Services, or may request
          information from buyers to ensure compliance with our policies and
          applicable law. In order to use certain products or services on Aether
          Meta, you may be required to complete an application; information that
          you submit through the application process will not be displayed
          publicly and will only be used internally by Aether Meta and its
          service providers, unless otherwise specified.

          and your shop on and off the platform, as provided for in Aether
          Meta’s Terms of Use or as otherwise legally required. From time to
          time, we may also ask you about certain demographic information, such

          On occasion, Aether Meta will need to contact you. Primarily, these

          notifications for a variety of reasons, including marketing,
          transactions, advocacy, and service update purposes. If you no longer
          wish to receive push notifications, you can disable them at device
          level. You can opt out of receiving marketing communications via email
          or Messages in your account settings or by following the unsubscribe

          receive notifications, we will need to collect certain information

          information. Every account is required to keep a valid email address
          on file to receive messages. Aether Meta may also contact you by
          telephone to provide member support or for transaction-related
          purposes if you request that we call you. Additionally, and with your
          consent where required by applicable law, Aether Meta may send you an
          SMS (or similar) message, or reach out to you by telephone, in order
          to provide you with customer support, for research or feedback, for
          security purposes when you enable two factor authentication in your
          account, or to provide you with information about products and
          features that you may find of interest. You can update your contact
          preferences in your account settings. When you contact a seller using
          Aether Meta Messages, the feature that allows buyers and sellers to
          communicate through the Services, we may share aggregated information
          about your use of the Services to sellers, for example if you are a

          service and so we improve our Site and Apps.

          providing community services to you and, in the context of that
          relationship, we need to share some of your information with such
          third parties in order to provide that service. This may include, for

          alongside the post. You are responsible for the personal information
          that you choose to post in community spaces through the Services. You
          can set your privacy preferences and download your data in your

          pursue our legitimate interests or those of a third party in ensuring

          Buying and Selling: As part of the buying and selling process, Aether

          members involved in the transaction, such as the other Aether Meta
          member&apos;s shipping address, email address, and payment status.
          This can also involve us sharing your information with some of our
          third party partners such as our shipping and payment partners to
          enable us to provide the Service to you. Such partners will process
          your personal information in accordance with their own privacy

          privacy and security requirements for vendors, these partners, not
          Aether Meta, are responsible for the protection of personal
          information under their control. By making a sale or a purchase on
          Aether Meta, you are directing us to share your information in this
          way. Since this is an important part of the Services we provide, we
          need to do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of
          Use. We may partner with third parties to enable you to make a

          connection with your purchase. The third party partner will share
          information collected from you with Aether Meta for purposes of
          fulfilling the order and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the

          described in Aether Meta&apos;s “Terms of Use”, you have a limited
          license to use that information only for Aether Meta-related
          communications or for Aether Meta-facilitated transactions. Aether
          Meta has not granted a license to you to use the information for
          unauthorized transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages
          in violation of any applicable laws, including any consent
          requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient. You should only add
          a member to your email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or
          store a member’s personal information in accordance with applicable
          laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that

          Legal and Safety: Aether Meta may also retain, preserve, or release

          circumstances: in response to lawful requests by public authorities,
          including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement

          defend against impending or asserted legal claims, including to

          activities, suspected fraud, threats to our rights or property, or
          violations of Aether Meta&apos;s “Terms of Use”. For example, if
          permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, your information may be
          shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies. In the
          cases set out above, our use of your information may be necessary for

          our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending

          prevention of tax fraud. It may also be necessary in the public

          information, which may include, but may not be limited to, a member’s

          Affiliated Businesses: Aether Meta is affiliated with a variety of
          businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes,
          including assisting us to perform and improve the Services. These
          businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or,
          with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to
          you. Aether Meta also provides services or sells products jointly with
          affiliated businesses, including providing you with the opportunity to
          sign up with such partners and allow them to more effectively market
          to you. When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your
          transaction, we may need to share information related to the
          transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your
          transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in
          accordance with our “Terms of Use”. We rely on consent (which can be
          withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party
          sharing relating to advertising. As part of this, we may work with
          advertising partners such as Facebook or Google, and we may use
          analytics aggregated from usage information including, for example,
          search keywords, favorites, browsing history, and purchase history.

          Aggregated Information: Aether Meta may share demographic information
          with business partners, but unless otherwise stated, it will be

          revealed.

          Service Providers: Aether Meta also needs to engage third-party
          companies and individuals (such as research companies, and analytics
          and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the
          Services. These third parties have only limited access to your
          information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on
          our behalf, and are obligated to Aether Meta not to disclose or use
          your information for other purposes. Our engagement of service
          providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you,
          particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us
          keep our Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these
          service providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the
          Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct
          research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter
          cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers
          to make our Services better.

          Business Reorganization: In some cases, Aether Meta may choose to buy
          or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our
          legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions
          that enable our business to develop over the long term. In these types
          of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or
          transfer of all or substantially all of Aether Meta’s assets), member
          information is typically one of the business assets that is
          transferred. If Aether Meta intends to transfer information about you,
          Aether Meta will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice
          on the Site and the App, and you will be afforded an opportunity to
          opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different
          privacy policy.

          a “Like” or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that

          account), or as needed to provide the Services to you. If you no
          longer want Aether Meta to use your information to provide the
          Services to you, you may close your account. Aether Meta will retain
          and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our
          legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your
          information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve
          disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this
          policy. In addition, Aether Meta sellers may also be required to
          retain and use your information in order to comply with their own
          legal obligations. Please note that closing your account may not free
          up your email address, username, or shop name (if any) for reuse on a
          new account. We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes.
          These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time,
          except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to
          improve site functionality, or we are legally obligated to retain them
          for longer time periods.

          9. Your Rights & Choices
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          Certain privacy laws around the world, including the European General
          Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy
          Act (CCPA), provide users with rights related to their personal
          information. Consistent with those laws, Aether Meta gives you the
          choice of accessing, editing, or removing certain information, as well
          as choices about how we contact you. You may change or correct your
          Aether Meta account information through your account settings. You may
          also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be
          publicly visible through the Services, such as your name. You can also
          request to permanently close your account and delete your personal
          information. Depending on your location, you may also benefit from a
          number of rights with respect to your information. While some of these
          rights apply generally, certain rights apply in limited cases.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Access & Portability: You can access certain personal
          information associated with your account by visiting your account
          privacy settings. You can request a copy of your personal information
          in an easily accessible format and information explaining how that
          information is used.

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Correction: You have the right to request that we rectify

          you can correct and change certain personal information associated
          with your account.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Restrict Processing: In certain cases where we process your
          information, you may also have the right to restrict or limit the ways
          in which we use your personal information.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Deletion: In certain circumstances, you have the right to

          we are required to retain by law, regulation, or to protect the
          safety, security, and integrity of Aether Meta.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Object: If we process your information based on our
          legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest,
          you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such
          cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have
          compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is
          needed for legal reasons. Where we use your personal data for direct
          marketing purposes, you can object using the unsubscribe link in such
          communications or changing your account email settings.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Withdraw Consent: Where we rely on consent, you can choose
          to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information using
          specific features provided to enable you to withdraw consent, like an
          email unsubscribe link or your account privacy preferences. If you
          have consented to share your precise device location details but would
          no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you can
          revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the
          settings on your mobile device. This is without prejudice to your
          right to generally permanently close your account and delete your
          personal information.

          The CCPA provides California residents with the following additional
          rights:
        </Text>
        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Know: California residents may request disclosure of the
          specific pieces and/or categories of personal information that the

          personal information, the business or commercial purposes for

        <Text variant="bodySmall" mb="16px">
          - Right to Opt-Out: To the extent that Aether Meta “sells” personal

          residents are entitled to opt-out of the “sale” of data at any time
          (see below for more information).

          otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a
          different level or quality of services, or charging you different
          prices or rates for services. If you need further assistance, you can
          contact Aether Meta through one of the channels listed below under

          timeframe.

          process any of the requests described in this Section, and in our
          discretion, deny your request if we are unable to verify your
          identity. As a part of this process, government or other
          identification may be required. You may designate an authorized agent
          to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized
          agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power
          of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification,
          and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification, and
