              Hundreds of years ago, a civilization from the stars stumbled upon
              a planet named Earth. The Earth was unlike any planet they had
              found before. Clean air, pure water and all the essential elements
              of life. It was almost the perfect paradise but for two problems.
              The human residents on the ground were rather detestable and the
              planet’s gravitational pull was stronger than they liked.

            <StyledText variant="body">
              For the travelers though, these issues were easily overcome.
              Drawing from their vast knowledge and skill, they crafted the
              Aether Orb. An object that allows impossibly heavy objects defy
              gravity’s oppressive pull.

            <StyledText variant="body">
              The travelers then enhanced the Orb with powers manipulating
              space, light and time. Minimal power lets it easily hold up
              cities, but with more energy, the orb opens light portals to other
              galaxies and slows time to a crawl.

            <StyledText variant="body">
              The travelers then partnered with the most enlightened earthbound
              artists, artisans and craftsman in order to enhance their flying
              city with the greatest parts of human culture. This cultural
              exchange allowed their floating cities to flourish, blending their
              incredible technology with the best parts of human creativity.
              This powerful exchange and enlightenment helped increase the
              amount of energy in the Orb and create wondrous opportunities for
              the denizens of the floating cities.

              Eons passed and the travelers moved on, seeking out new planets.
              They abandoned the Aether Orb, leaving it listless in the sky.
              Without the travelers, the Orb’s power slowly faded, becoming a
              shallow memory of its once vast power.

              From the moment our feet touched the terraced gardens, we knew
              this place was special. It was as if something within us changed.
              The Aether Orb calmed our spirits, banishing reality and struggles
              of life on the ground. The Orb seemed to appreciate our presence
              as well, growing stronger as we built and interacted with it.

              We named this land AetherMeta and we plan on restoring it to its
